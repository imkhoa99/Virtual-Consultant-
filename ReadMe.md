###### Welcome to the world of advice given by an AI consultant :)

**Description of the program:** 
1. The program converses with the user via a graphical user interface. 
2. It listens to the worries of the user, asks the user questions about the topics that come up and gives "advice". This virtual consultant could examine the feeling of the user based on their input, and proceed to feeling evaluation to see how to give a reasonable advice. The more details the user expresses, the better understanding the program becomes. 
3. The consulting session will last until the user indicates to end by saying "good bye". 
4. The program has an archive mode that allows the user if he/she wants to store the conversation into a file, and it comes together with a timestamp.
5. Additional feature: During the session, the program prints inspirational quotes from well-renowned people in the world, so that it makes the conversation more inspiring and encouraging.
6. Due to the external file saving, the level of intelligence of the AI consultant is user-modifiable, which means the user can modify the program to be used in different languages than English, also suit to their own favor. 
7. The AI would know if the user has entered with invalid inputs (for example: blank input) and it keeps asking the user to retype until the valid input is found.
